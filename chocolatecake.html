<u><b><font size="5" color = "black" face= "courier new">Recipe for cake base</font></b></u>
<p><br>225g/8oz plain flour<br>
<br>350g/12Â½oz caster sugar<br>
<br>85g/3oz cocoa powder<br>
<br>1Â½ tsp baking powder<br>
<br>1Â½ tsp bicarbonate of soda<br>
<br>2 free-range eggs<br>
<br>250ml/9fl oz milk<br>
<br>125ml/4Â½fl oz vegetable oil<br>
<br>2 tsp vanilla extract<br>
<br>250ml/9fl oz boiling water<br></p>
<br><u><b><font size="5" color = "black" face= "courier new">Icing</font></b></u><br>
<br>200g/7oz plain chocolate<br>
<br>200ml/7fl oz double cream<br>
<br><u><b><font size="5" color = "black" face= "courier new">Method</font></b></u><br>
<br>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease and line two 20cm/8in sandwich tins.<br>

<br>For the cake, place all of the cake ingredients, except the boiling water, into a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon, or electric whisk, beat the mixture until smooth and well combined.

Add the boiling water to the mixture, a little at a time, until smooth. (The cake mixture will now be very liquid.)<br>

<br>Divide the cake batter between the sandwich tins and bake in the oven for 25â€“35 minutes, or until the top is firm to the touch and a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.<br>

<br>Remove the cakes from the oven and allow to cool completely, still in their tins, before icing.<br>

<br>For the chocolate icing, heat the chocolate and cream in a saucepan over a low heat until the chocolate melts. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk the mixture until smooth, glossy and thickened. Set aside to cool for 1â€“2 hours, or until thick enough to spread over the cake.<br>

<br>To assemble the cake, run a round-bladed knife around the inside of the cake tins to loosen the cakes. Carefully remove the cakes from the tins.<br>
